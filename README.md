# Data Science Projects
Collection of smaller data science projects (time frame == some hours to some days...).

## [Ames House Price Prediction](https://github.com/rnckp/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Ames%20House%20Prices)
Slightly edited and condensed version of one of five projects for EPFL course [«Data Science: Applied Machine Learning»](https://www.extensionschool.ch/applied-data-science-machine-learning).
- Main techniques: EDA, data preparation and cleaning, outlier removal, regression modelling with various classifiers, scikit pipelines.


## [Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction](https://github.com/rnckp/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Costa%20Rica%20Poverty%20Levels)
Final project for [Advanced Machine Learning course at FHNW](https://www.fhnw.ch/de/weiterbildung/technik/advanced-machine-learning).
- Students were pointed to the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction) and had to analyze the data, train models and submit predictions. 
- Main techniques: Regression modelling with various classifiers, scikit pipelines, LightGBM, hyperparameter tuning with GridSearch/RandomSearch, [Hyperopt](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt) and [scikit-optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/), [category encoding](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/), data aggregation with [featuretools](https://www.featuretools.com/), analyzing feature importances with permutation, creating interaction features, oversampling with [imbalanced-learn](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/).


## [Spaceship Titanic Challenge](https://github.com/rnckp/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Spaceship%20Titanic)
Quick EDA and some modelling test runs for Kaggles [Spaceship Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview).
- Main techniques: EDA, data preparation and cleaning, classification modelling with various classifiers, scikit pipelines.


## [San Francisco Purchasing Data](https://github.com/rnckp/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/San%20Francisco%20Purchasing%20Data%20Analysis)
Project for course [«Data Science Project Competence» at FHNW](https://www.fhnw.ch/de/weiterbildung/technik/data-science-projektkompetenz).

- Just the data was given. Students were supposed to analyse the data, present insights and propose appropriate data products. I addition to that I created [a working data dashboard with Streamlit](https://github.com/rnckp/San-Francisco-Purchasing-Data-Dashboard).


## [Swiss Real Estate Analysis & Price Prediction](https://github.com/rnckp/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Swiss%20Real%20Estate%20Price%20Analysis%20%26%20Modelling)
Quick EDA and regression modelling for a Machine Learning Lab during [Data Science studies at FHNW](https://www.fhnw.ch/de/weiterbildung/technik/das-data-science). 

- Just the real estate data was given. 
- The project was setup as a closed Kaggle competition. Students had to compete and beat teachers' models.


## [Podcast Lengths Analysis](https://github.com/rnckp/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Podcast%20Lengths%20Analysis)
Quick examination of podcast lengths to help quantify creative choices for podcast producers. I analysed ~225k episodes of ~1.8k iTunes podcasts and 37k episodes of ~800 Spotify podcasts. 

Findings: 
- A prototypical length of a podcast episode is around 40 minutes.
- 90% of all podcast episodes have a length between 20 and 60 minutes.
- Typical lengths vary between the different genres – with median values between 15 and 65 minutes.
